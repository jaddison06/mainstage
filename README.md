# mainstage

Mainstage allows you to create smooth, native-looking UIs, for any platform, from a single codebase. With Mainstage you can build high-level, object-oriented UIs - or you can work with the nuts & bolts of the operating system. Mainstage exposes APIs that give you full control over your target device - whatever OS it's running.
